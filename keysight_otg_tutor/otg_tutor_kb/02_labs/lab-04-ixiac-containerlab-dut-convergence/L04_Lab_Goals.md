**Key Components:**
- **Ixia-C-One**: All-in-one container with integrated controller, traffic engines, and protocol engines
- **iBGP Configuration**: Internal BGP peering between eth2/eth3 and Nokia SRL
- **Route Advertisement**: Both BGP peers advertise the same IPv4 prefixes with different attributes
- **Convergence Testing**: Link down and route withdrawal events to test network recovery

## üìä Test Specifications
- **Protocol Emulation**: iBGP peering with route advertisement and traffic generation
- **BGP Configuration**: Internal BGP with Local Preference and MED attributes
- **Route Advertisement**: IPv4 unicast prefixes advertised by both BGP peers
- **Traffic Pattern**: Bidirectional flows using BGP-learned routes as destinations
- **Convergence Events**: Link failure simulation and route withdrawal testing
- **Recovery Analysis**: Convergence time measurement and traffic loss analysis
- **Orchestration**: ContainerLab deployment with all-in-one traffic generator

## üéØ Key Differences from Previous Labs
| Aspect | Lab 01 | Lab 02 | Lab 03 | Lab 04 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Focus** | Basic B2B traffic | BGP protocol testing | Egress tracking | BGP convergence testing |
| **Containers** | 3 (Controller + 2 TEs) | 5 (+ 2 PEs) | 6 (+ Nokia SRL) | 2 (Ixia-C-One + Nokia SRL) |
| **Deployment** | Docker commands | Docker Compose | ContainerLab | ContainerLab |
| **Traffic Generator** | Separate components | Separate components | Separate components | All-in-one container |
| **Protocol** | None | eBGP | None (egress tracking) | iBGP with convergence |
| **DUT Role** | None | None | Packet transformation | Route reflection & convergence |
| **Testing Focus** | Connectivity | Protocol establishment | Packet modifications | Network recovery time |

## üî¨ Lab Test Actions
This test includes BGP protocol emulation, traffic generation, and convergence validation:

### **BGP Protocol Configuration:**
- **iBGP Peer Creation**: Creates iBGP peers on eth2 and eth3 interfaces
- **Route Advertisement**: Both peers advertise several IPv4 unicast prefixes
- **Attribute Configuration**: Sets BGP Local Preference and MED values for path selection
- **Route Reflection**: Nokia SRL acts as route reflector for iBGP peers

### **Traffic Generation:**
- **Bidirectional Flows**: Creates flows using BGP-learned routes as sources and destinations
- **Route-Based Traffic**: Traffic follows BGP best path selection
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time traffic monitoring during convergence events

### **Convergence Testing:**
- **Link Down Event**: Simulates physical link failure to trigger convergence
- **Route Withdrawal**: Soft failure through BGP UPDATE messages
- **Recovery Measurement**: Calculates convergence time based on packet loss and recovery
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitors traffic path changes during convergence events

## üéØ Expected Learning Outcomes
After completing this lab, you will understand:
- ContainerLab orchestration with all-in-one traffic generators
- iBGP configuration and route reflection concepts
- BGP path selection with Local Preference and MED attributes
- Network convergence principles and measurement techniques
- Difference between hard failures (link down) and soft failures (route withdrawal)
- Convergence time calculation methodologies
- Traffic pattern analysis during network recovery
- Production-ready network resilience testing approaches

## üîç Convergence Testing Deep Dive
This lab demonstrates advanced **network convergence testing** capabilities:

### **What Gets Tested:**
- **BGP Session Recovery**: How quickly BGP sessions recover after failure
- **Route Convergence**: Time for routing table updates and path selection
- **Traffic Recovery**: Actual data plane recovery and packet forwarding restoration
- **Path Selection**: BGP best path algorithm during failure scenarios

### **Why Convergence Testing Matters:**
- **Network Resilience**: Validates network's ability to recover from failures
- **SLA Compliance**: Ensures recovery times meet service level agreements  
- **Capacity Planning**: Understanding failure impact on network performance
- **Operational Readiness**: Validates network behavior before production deployment

### **Types of Convergence Events:**
```
Hard Failure (Link Down):
[BGP Peer 1] --X-- [DUT] ---- [BGP Peer 2] ‚Üí Physical link failure

Soft Failure (Route Withdrawal):
[BGP Peer 1] ~~~~ [DUT] ---- [BGP Peer 2] ‚Üí BGP UPDATE withdrawal
```

## üéØ Convergence Metrics Analysis

### **Key Metrics Measured:**
- **Detection Time**: How quickly the failure is detected
- **Convergence Time**: Total time for network to converge to new state
- **Packet Loss**: Number of packets lost during convergence
- **Recovery Pattern**: Traffic flow changes during recovery

### **Calculation Method:**
```
Convergence Time = (Lost Packets √∑ Transmission Rate) seconds

Example:
- Lost Packets: 50
- Transmission Rate: 100 pps
- Convergence Time: 50 √∑ 100 = 0.5 seconds
```
