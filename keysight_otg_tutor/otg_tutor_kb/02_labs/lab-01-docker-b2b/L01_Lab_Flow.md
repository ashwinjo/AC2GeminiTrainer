**Check Prerequisites:**
1. Ask user to confirm Docker installation: `docker --version`
2. Verify Python 3.8+: `python3 --version`
3. Check sudo access: `sudo echo "test"`
4. Confirm basic networking knowledge

**Adaptive Response:**
- If prerequisites missing â†’ Guide to **S01_environment_prerequisites.md**
- If Docker issues â†’ Reference **T02_docker_daemon_not_running.md**
- If Python issues â†’ Reference **T01_python_module_not_found.md**
- If all good â†’ Proceed to Phase 1

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What's your experience level with Docker? (beginner/intermediate/advanced)"
- "Have you worked with network testing tools before?"
- "Would you prefer step-by-step guidance or more independent exploration?"

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
**Tutor Action: Guide through initial setup**

**Learning Checkpoint 1.1: Understanding the Architecture**
- Show architecture diagram from **L01_Lab_Goals.md**
- Ask: "Can you explain what back-to-back testing means?"

- If incorrect â†’ Provide explanation and reference **L01_FAQ.md** Q1

**Learning Checkpoint 1.2: Docker Image Setup**
- Guide user through **L01_Lab_Configuration.md** Step 1
- Ask user to execute: `docker pull` commands
- Validate: `docker images | grep -E "(keng-controller|ixia-c-traffic-engine)"`

**Validation Questions:**
- "Why do we use specific image versions rather than 'latest'?"
- "What's the difference between the controller and traffic engine containers?"

**Adaptive Response:**
- If user struggles with Docker â†’ Provide more detailed explanations
- If user is advanced â†’ Allow them to proceed faster
- If errors occur â†’ Reference **L01_Troubleshooting.md**

### Phase 2: Network Interface Creation
**Tutor Action: Explain virtual networking concepts**

**Learning Checkpoint 2.1: Virtual Interfaces**
- Explain veth pairs concept
- Guide user through **L01_Lab_Configuration.md** Step 2
- Guide through: `sudo ip link add name veth0 type veth peer name veth1`
- Validate: `ip link show | grep veth`

**Interactive Questions:**
- "What happens when we create a veth pair?"
- "Why do we need virtual interfaces for this lab?"

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
- Permission errors â†’ Guide to use `sudo`
- Interface already exists â†’ Show cleanup commands
- Network namespace issues â†’ Provide troubleshooting steps

### Phase 3: Container Deployment
**Tutor Action: Guide through container orchestration**

**Learning Checkpoint 3.1: Controller Container**
- Explain controller role in OTG architecture
- Guide through controller startup
- Guide user through **L01_Lab_Configuration.md** Step 3

**Learning Checkpoint 3.2: Traffic Engine Containers**
- Explain traffic engine purpose
- Guide user through **L01_Lab_Configuration.md** Step 4
- Guide through both traffic engine deployments
- Validate: `docker ps | grep ixia-c-traffic-engine`

**Interactive Validation:**
- "How many containers should be running now?" (Expected: 3)
- "What ports are the containers listening on?"
- "What would happen if we used the same port for both traffic engines?"

**Troubleshooting Triggers:**
- Port conflicts â†’ Reference **T04_port_is_already_allocated.md**
- Container startup failures â†’ Check **L01_Troubleshooting.md**
- Network connectivity issues â†’ Validate Docker networking

### Phase 4: Test Execution
**Tutor Action: Guide through traffic generation**

**Learning Checkpoint 4.1: Code Understanding**
- Walk through **L01_Code_lab-01_test.py.md**
- Ask: "What traffic parameters are configured in the test?"
- Expected: 2000 packets, 100 pps, bidirectional

**Learning Checkpoint 4.2: Test Execution**
- Guide user to run: `python3 L01_lab_01_test.py`
- Monitor execution in real-time
- Ask user to observe the output

**Interactive Analysis:**
- "How long did the test take to complete?"
- "What was the actual vs expected duration?"
- "Were there any packet losses? Why or why not?"

**Real-time Troubleshooting:**
- Connection errors â†’ Check container status
- Import errors â†’ Reference **T01_python_module_not_found.md**

- Explain different metric types

**Critical Thinking Questions:**
- "Why might there be a difference between interface counters and OTG metrics?"
- "What factors could cause packet loss in a B2B setup?"
- "How would you troubleshoot if packets weren't being received?"

### Phase 6: Hands-on Challenge
