# C01: What is OTG (Open Traffic Generator)?

## üåê Introduction
Open Traffic Generator (OTG) is a modern, vendor-neutral approach to network traffic generation and testing. It represents a paradigm shift from traditional, proprietary traffic generation tools to an open, standardized, and API-driven methodology.

## üéØ Core Concept
OTG is **not a specific product** but rather a **specification and methodology** for:
- Defining traffic generation configurations
- Controlling traffic generation equipment
- Collecting and analyzing traffic statistics
- Enabling vendor-neutral network testing

Think of OTG as the "HTTP of traffic generation" - a common language that different tools and vendors can implement.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Traditional vs. OTG Approach

**Traditional Traffic Generators:**
```
[Proprietary GUI] ‚Üí [Vendor-Specific API] ‚Üí [Hardware/Software]
     ‚Üì
[Vendor Lock-in] + [Limited Automation] + [Complex Integration]
```

**OTG Approach:**
```
[Standard API] ‚Üí [OTG Implementation] ‚Üí [Any Hardware/Software]
     ‚Üì
[Vendor Neutral] + [Full Automation] + [Easy Integration]
```

### Key Components
1. **OTG API Specification**: Standardized REST API for traffic control
2. **Configuration Models**: JSON/YAML schemas for test definitions
3. **Statistics Models**: Standardized metrics and counters
4. **Implementation Libraries**: Client libraries in various languages

## üîß How OTG Works

### 1. Configuration Phase
```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "tx_device",
      "ports": [{"name": "tx_port", "location": "eth0"}]
    },
    {
      "name": "rx_device", 
      "ports": [{"name": "rx_port", "location": "eth1"}]
    }
  ],
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "test_flow",
      "tx": {"device": "tx_device", "port": "tx_port"},
      "rx": {"device": "rx_device", "port": "rx_port"},
      "rate": {"pps": 1000},
      "size": {"fixed": 64}
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Execution Phase
```python
# Apply configuration
POST /config

# Start traffic
POST /control/start

# Monitor statistics
GET /results/metrics

# Stop traffic
POST /control/stop
```

### 3. Analysis Phase
```json
{
  "flow_metrics": [
    {
      "name": "test_flow",
      "frames_tx": 10000,
      "frames_rx": 9999,
      "bytes_tx": 640000,
      "bytes_rx": 639936
    }
  ]
}
```

## üåü Key Benefits

- **Kubernetes Ready**: Orchestrate at scale

### 4. Open Source Ecosystem
- **Transparent**: Open specifications and implementations
- **Community-Driven**: Collaborative development
- **Extensible**: Easy to add custom features

## üîÑ OTG vs. Traditional Tools

| Aspect | Traditional Tools | OTG |
|--------|------------------|-----|
